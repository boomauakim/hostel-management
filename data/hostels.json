It can house up to 6 people, 2 in each of the two bedrooms and 2 in the living room. The house has a number of very unique elements that you might not find elsewhere, like the layered wooden walls, shuttered windows, traditional Thai sliding doors, tree trunks as supporting pillars and branches as design elements of furniture and railings. Our experience is that it takes our guests a few hours before they can feel at home, as they often find themselves initially stunned by the beauty and the atmosphere of the house and the breath-taking view.<br><br>In every corner of the house and the outside deck you can enjoy good quality wifi. If you stay with us for more than a week, we provide a once-weekly cleaning service to make your stay pleasant.<br><br>The house is NOT SUITABLE for very young children. Both floors boast large decks that are NOT FENCED. Therefore, there is a realistic danger of falling into the sea in high tide, or even worse, onto rocks in low tide. If you choose to book the house with your children, make sure they are mature enough to understand the danger and behave accordingly.<br><br>Please also note that there is NO air-conditioning in the house. The open way the house is built, allows for plenty of natural sea breeze and there are many fans to cool you down. But if air conditioning is a must for you, our house is not suitable.","amenities":{"wifi":true,"tv":true,"pool":false,"kitchen":true,"parking":true,"elevator":false},"createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1581786476475"}},"updatedAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1581786476475"}},"id":{"$numberInt":"1"},"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
